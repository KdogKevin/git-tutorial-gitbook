# What is git?

`git` is a _version control system_ (vcs) used by many programmers today.  

Think of a vcs as a backup for your files (like Mac's Time Machine).  

- It helps you make 'copies' as you go, in case you do something wrong and need to go back.  
- It also provides you with a time frame of your changes.

Having a time frame of changes is useful not only as a way to see how far you've come, but also can be really helpful when tracking down a bug.  "I first experienced the bug about a week ago..." and you can see what changed around then.

Other types of vcs include `svn`, `mercurial`, and `cvs`.  We will only discuss `git` in this tutorial.

## Why do I need a version control system?

- Having a log of your changes makes it much easier to track down and fix bugs.
- It gives you the freedom to explore different ideas at the _same time_ without losing one or the other (see branching later).
- It makes collaborating and contributing to projects much easier.  By using a vcs, you can see _exactly_ what someone changed on your project, so you can evaluate if you want to incorporate the change or not.  (see pull requests later)

## Why choose git?

I can't tell you why you should use `git` over the other vcs choices.  Personally, I think its the best.  Its also one of the most popular, having an entire website of projects based around it (GitHub).

## GitHub Username

If you are going through this during a live workshop, hopefully the presenter or someone else has started (or finished) collecting your GitHub usernames.  They will be needed when we get to the GitHub related portion to demonstrate different concepts.

If you are going through this at home, you will have the option to _fork_ the repo before you _clone_ it.  You'll miss out on experiencing some of the collaborative examples, but screenshots will be provided.

# git init

Currently, our lone file is not being version controlled.  If we change it or delete it, its gone.  Let's change that.

In order to change our `git_tutorial` folder into a git **repository (repo)** we need to use `git init`.

```
$ git init
```

If you do an `ls -la`, you'll see that a new directory has been added `.git`.
